# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

ATLAS AI is an open-source AI project built by the collaboration of several fields, researchers, and professionals.

This project is for professionals who have gone through the [Lineage](https://github.com/ennas-de/lineage) repository and have a clear understanding of the history, evolution, and transcendence of Artificial Intelligence.

#### IMPORTANT

Please do not contribute to this project untill you have gone through the entire `Lineage` tutorials and guides.

## PROJECT AIM

The aim of this project is to evolve, standardize, and extend the field of Artificial Intelligence as a multi-disciplinary knowledge. Not a solitary and confirned field.
AI evolved and benefited several fields and knowledge, and I believe it still needs to connect to many more fields to transcend further.

## PROJECT GOALS

As an Engineer with background and working experience in Clinical Neuro-Physiology, I have seen many clinical cases that I believe we could 'program' a machine to complement. I have battled a lot of thoughts on how we can use machines to help augment some neurological cases.
But how do we do this when the AI that is supposed to work in sync with this and many other fields is in complete isolation?

The field of Artificial Intelligence needs to work together with many fields of life in order to evolve and complement one another.

The goal is never to replace not even a single human. We need AI to boost human efficiency, NOT REPLACE HUMANS.
No matter how great AI is, it is not designed to 'be like a human'. This has been discussed in length in the `Lineage` AI repo.

The Human brain has billions of neurons, and has gone through thousands (and more) years of evolution. It is redundant to build AI to mimick this already optimized and specialized aspect of the human brain.

So, like the Researchers before me, I also hold the believe that 'rational-agent' is the right choice and path for AI to take. This ideology will be what this project will be working with.

It is my desire to connect AI using this repo to these fields (and many more):

1. Medical and Health Sciences
2. Mathematics
3. Statistics
4. Engineering
5. Networking
6. Robotics
7. Business
8. Security
9. Retail
10. Transportation

and many more (that will be added).
